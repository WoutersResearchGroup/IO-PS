# IO-PS
Public repository of code related to research on the input-output product space (IO-PS) 
[Described in Bam, W., &amp; De Bruyne, K. (2019). Improving Industrial Policy Intervention: The Case of Steel in South Africa. The Journal of Development Studies, 55(11), 2460–2475. https://doi.org/10.1080/00220388.2018.1528354]
## Current content
The repository currently contains the MATLAB code used in the original IO-PS paper mentioned above, as well as various extensions. For now, this includes:
1. Basic MATLAB functions to calculate product space-related metrics
2. The full IO-PS as presented in the above paper, but with a version added to use average metrics in the product space instead of average metrics in the value chain
3. A version of the IO-PS that can be used for panel data analysis (as used in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42214-020-00081-7)
4. Code for drawing tradeoff figure (as used in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42214-020-00081-7)
## Upcoming content
The research group is continually working on extending our reseaerch and making available new developments. Additions that are close to completion and that will be added soon include:
1. IO-PS implemented in Python
2. IO-PS implemented in R
3. Extended IO-PS with sustainability metrics
